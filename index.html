    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p> The task of this project was to explore a Knowledge Graph through the use of SPARQL queries to find gaps in the contents of the ontology. Furthermore, the group was supposed to enrich the knowledge graph creating new triples.
    The task was meant to be accomplished using Large Language Models as a tool to create the SPARQL queries and retrieve useful information.
    Our group decided to explore the <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/"> ArCo </a> knowledge graph, because we all used it at least once during our lessons and because the course material we had most easy access to concerned this portal. 
    Furthermore, we wanted to investigate a portion of the cultural and architectural heritage of the city of Bologna, therefore ArCo seemed the best option because it is a Knowledge graph dedicated to Cultural heritage.</p>
   <h2> The monuments </h2>
<p> We decided to investigate some of the most characteristic architectural landmarks of the city of Bologna: the Gates of the city. 
 These massive gates are one of the numerous testimonies of the rich medieval history of this beautiful city and they amaze tourists, locals and anyone who walks around the perimeter of the old walls. 
 The medieval walls with the Gates are known in Italian as "Terza Cinta" or "Circla," there were originally twelve Gates to protect the city and control the access to the center. There are ten remaining gates that still stand tall as marks of the greatness of the city in Medieval times. 
The people of Bologna are proud of this testimony of greateness and the administration of the city recognizes the historical importance of the Gates, with regular interventions, restorations and protection initiatives. 
 As we understand the value of the Gates as cultural heritage for the city we study in, we decided to focus on six of the Gates to investigate different points of view and characteristics. 
 The Gates we analysed are Porta Maggiore, Porta Castiglione, Porta delle Lame, Porta San Donato, Porta San Vitale and Porta San Mamolo, which was demolished but in our opinion still deserved to be mentioned in the ontology.
