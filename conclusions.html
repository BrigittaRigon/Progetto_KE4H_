    <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>
    <p>Throughout this project, we explored the use of SPARQL queries, ArCo, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the quantity and quality of information about the entities of the principal Gates in Bologna. Even though the Gates are all of the same importance, they were described very differently in the arco ontology. Therefore, it made sense to enrich them all to try and bring them to similar levels of description.
     Here are all the potential triples we created to enrich the knowledge graph for each entity:

  <h2>What we learned</h2>
    <p>1.To make queries to investigate a KG and find relevant information;</p>
    <p>2.To design triples by using SPARQL CONSTRUCT and LLMs;</p>
    <p>3.To prompt LLMs and the importance of verifying and evaluating their outputs;</p>
    <p>4.To create a website reporting the details and results of our project;</p>
    <p>5.To think creatively and problem solve in front of something we are not familiar with.</p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>In final analysis, this project served as a compelling practical application of how Linked Open Data, SPARQL, and Large Language Models can converge to advance cultural heritage preservation. The work on Porta Maggiore, Porta delle Lame, Porta Castiglione and Porta San Donato and Porta San Mamolo illustrates a powerful synergy: while the ArCo ontology provided a robust foundational structure, LLMs acted as a creative catalyst for query design and information discovery. Crucially, this was complemented by essential human verification and research, which ensured accuracy and added rich, contextual layers of detail‚Äîfrom materials and construction dates to local dialect and design history. More than just a technical exercise, the project was a deeply engaging journey of learning and problem-solving. It underscored that the true potential of AI is unlocked not by replacing human expertise, but by augmenting it, allowing us to collaboratively enrich shared knowledge resources like Wikidata and, in this case, deepen the digital narrative of Bologna's iconic monuments for researchers and the public alike. The project also demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and human intelligence can work together to enrich a KG like ArCo.</p>
