Report: Porta San Mamolo
Choice of the “porta” and the information to be entered
Porta San Mamolo
Construction date: XII century
Bolognese dialect name: Porta ed San Mamel
Drawbridge added: 1334
Demolition: 1903
Building material: bricks
Porta San Mamolo was one of Bologna’s city gates, historically significant for controlling the northern entrance. It was demolished in the early 20th century. I decided to enrich its profile using ArCo ontology given its historical and architectural importance.

Verification of the data present on ArCo
I ran a SELECT query to search for information about Porta San Mamolo, without giving an example (zero shot)
PREFIX rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX arco: <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?porta ?label
WHERE {
  ?porta rdf:type arco:ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage .
  
  { ?porta rdfs:label ?label }
  UNION { ?porta arco-core:hasTitle ?title .
          ?title rdfs:label ?label }
  UNION { ?porta arco-core:hasDenomination ?den .
          ?den rdfs:label ?label }

  FILTER (REGEX(STR(?label), "Porta", "i"))
  FILTER (REGEX(STR(?label), "Bologna", "i"))
}
LIMIT 100

No results were found, confirming that Porta San Mamolo is not yet present in ArCo.

Adding information with ChatGPT and ArCo properties
I asked ChatGPT to create CONSTRUCT queries using ArCo ontology to add the missing information, giving it a query construct as an example (one shot).

Explanation of properties of the ArCo ontology: 
arco-cons:hasConstructionDevelopment: indicates the main construction period (XII century).
arco-den:hasMaterial: specifies the building material (brick).
arco-event:hasRelatedEvent: records the addition of the drawbridge in 1334.
arco-core:describes: stores descriptive information, including the dialect name.
arco-core:hasNote: records the demolition date.

Adding information with Gemini
I asked Gemini to create SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries to enrich Porta San Mamolo in ArCo, using the information we collected. This time, I didn’t give the LLM any example (zero shot)

Explanation:
Gemini generated queries directly using ArCo properties, producing RDF triples readable by Virtuoso.
Each query corresponds to a distinct type of information: historical, architectural, and descriptive.
The resulting RDF graph can now be queried, visualized, or further enriched.

ASK and DESCRIBE queries with ChatGPT and Gemini
ASK query to check demolition:
PREFIX arco-core: <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/>

ASK {
  <https://dati.beniculturali.it/resource/CulturalProperty/0800249999>
    arco-core:hasNote "Demolished in 1903"@en .
}
DESCRIBE query to retrieve all information:
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX arco-core: <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/core/>

DESCRIBE <https://dati.beniculturali.it/resource/CulturalProperty/0800249999>

The answer to the first query is “false”, as the information are not on the KG yet. On the other hand, the second query is empty.

Comparison with LLMs
ChatGPT: helped generate CONSTRUCT queries and explanations, using a one shot prompt. Chat GPT uses more general URIs
Gemini: provided structured queries with proper ArCo URIs and readable RDF triple, without examples (zero shot prompt). Gemini also uses URIs which are more precise

Summary
Technical Summary: Semantic Enrichment of Porta San Mamolo Using ArCo Ontology
This work presents the semantic modeling and RDF enrichment of historical data for Porta San Mamolo, a former city gate of Bologna, within the ArCo ontology framework.
Data Acquisition and Validation
Historical and architectural metadata were collected, including: construction in the 12th century, Bolognese dialect name “Porta ed San Mamel”, addition of a drawbridge in 1334, demolition in 1903, and building material brick.
SPARQL SELECT queries confirmed that Porta San Mamolo was absent from the ArCo knowledge graph (KG), validating the need for structured integration.
RDF Modeling via SPARQL CONSTRUCT
CONSTRUCT queries were generated to encode key properties:
Construction period → arco-cons:hasConstructionDevelopment
Material → arco-den:hasMaterial
Related event (drawbridge) → arco-event:hasRelatedEvent
Descriptive information (dialect name) → arco-core:describes
Demolition date → arco-core:hasNote
Queries were expressed with canonical ArCo URIs and appropriate language tags (@en, @bo), producing RDF triples compatible with Virtuoso and other triple stores.
SPARQL Verification Queries
ASK queries were used to validate the presence of demolition information, returning false.
DESCRIBE queries confirmed the absence of Porta San Mamolo in the KG, demonstrating the need for insertion.
LLM-Assisted Query Generation
ChatGPT produced CONSTRUCT queries via one-shot prompting.
Gemini generated structured RDF triples using zero-shot prompting, using precise ArCo ontology terms.
Outcome 
Porta San Mamolo’s historical, architectural, and descriptive data have been formally represented in RDF, ready for ingestion into the ArCo KG.
