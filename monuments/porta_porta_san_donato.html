    <h1>Porta San Donato (also known as Porta Zamboni)</h1>
    <p>
     Porta San Donato, also known as Porta Zamboni, was built in the 13th century on the road to 
Argenta and Ferrara. It was part of a bigger complex together with houses for guards. A drawbridge 
over the moat was built in 1354. The gate was closed and walled up for security reasons in 1428 
but reopened again some decades later. As the gate San Donato is located on the crossing of main 
streets (the ring boulevard and Via San Donato), it run the risk to be demolished several times, 
especially in 1952 and 1959 when finally only one metre of wall was destroyed after a heated 
debate to resolve traffic problems.
I decided to enrich this entity because it is one of the most iconic gates of Bologna, since it is 
located at the very beginning of Via Zamboni, which leads to the university area of the city

    <h2>USE OF LLMS TO FIND OUT ABOUT ESSENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>First of all, I used the same zero shot prompting to ask about the properties of the entity I considered worth describing to different AI:
‚ÄúCan you tell me the name in bolognese, the dimension, the technique, the material, the authorship attribution and the conservation intervention of Porta Zamboni (Porta San Donato) in Bologna?‚Äù
</p>
    <h2>DeepSeek's answer:</h2>
   <!-- IMAGE -->
    <div class="img-container">
    <img src=https://github.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-08-30%20104031.png">
    </div>
    <p>Deepseek‚Äôs answer looks precise about almost every aspect, except the actual dimensions of the gate (but It says to look for them into the archival plans). It also made a summary with the most important information even though It wasn‚Äôt asked to.</p>

       <h2>Gemini's answer:</h2>h2>
       <p>Here are the details you requested about Porta Zamboni, also known as Porta San Donato, in Bologna.
1.	Name and Historical Context
2.	The gate is known in Bolognese as Porta San Dun√† or more colloquially, Porta Zamboni. It's named after its location at the end of Via San Donato and Via Zamboni, near the university area. The gate was part of the third and final circle of medieval city walls built in the 13th century.
3.	Dimensions
4.	The exact dimensions of Porta San Donato, such as its height, width, and depth, are not commonly cited in general descriptions. However, it is a significant structure that includes the gate itself and a machicolated tower. It's one of the remaining gates of Bologna's former city walls.
5.	Technique and Material
6.	The construction technique is typical of medieval fortifications, using brick and stone. The structure primarily consists of a central arched gate and a tower, built with a combination of these durable materials. The technique would be that of a skilled medieval workforce, likely using lime mortar.
7.	Authorship Attribution
8.	Like most medieval city gates, the authorship or architect of Porta San Donato is unknown. These structures were typically built by master builders and laborers under the direction of the city's governing bodies rather than by a single, named architect.
9.	Conservation Intervention
10.	Porta San Donato has undergone several conservation efforts throughout its history, with significant work done in the 20th and 21st centuries. Notably, it was isolated in 1903 after the demolition of the city walls. More recently, a major restoration project was carried out between 2007 and 2009. These interventions are crucial to preserving the gate's structural integrity and historical appearance, especially given the constant threat from urban traffic and environmental factors.
After that, I verified the information with other sources like Wikipedia ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porta_San_Donato_(Bologna) ), the site of the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna ( https://digital.fondazionecarisbo.it/artwork/bologna-porta-zamboni-gia-san-donato-esterno-11608-2021-07-20t12-36-07-891z ) and bologna-guide.com (https://www.bologna-guide.com/it/porta-san-donato/ ):
</p>
       INSERIRE IMMAGINE
       <p>The first thing we can notice is that Deepseek says that the name in bolognese is p√¥rta San Dun√®, confirming the description present in Wikipedia, whereas Gemini calls it p√¥rta San Dun√†. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always essential to compare different sources of information. The building year and the year in which the is confirmed in both sites, but the restoration year is different from Deepseek‚Äôs answer (2015) to Gemini‚Äôs answer and Wikipedia (2007 and 2009). Also, I tried to verify the fact that it was commissioned by Pope Julius II but I didn‚Äôt find any site that confirmed that. Finally, another interesting and reliable information is that a drawbridge was added in 1354.</p>
       
    <h2>SPARQL Query 1: Retrieve the Gate</h2>
    <p>
      The following query searches for the monument labeled as

<p>After that, I explored the webpage and I noticed that some of the main properties the of the entity were already present, such as information about its layout, design, covering and different kinds of cadastral documentations: https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage/0800241652.html</p>
   INSERIRE IMMAGINE
      <h2>SPARQL Query 3:SELECT</h2>
      <p>Therefore, I proceed with a SELECT query, using the OPTIONAL function to see the properties worth describing that can be missing from the knowledge graph. I decided to ask Chatgpt through a 2 shot prompting, and I always specified the Unique Identifier of the entity (0800241652) and the fact that I was working to enrich the ArCo ontology:
‚Äúcreate a query with the SELECT and OPTIONAL function to see the properties worth describing that can be missing from the knowledge graph of Porta Zamboni (0800241652) in Arco ontology. use these two queries as an example: 
</p>
      <h2>SPARQL Query 4:CONSTRUCT</h2>h2>
      <p>Then, I proceeded by using Deepseek with a 0 shot prompting, specifying what I wanted to focus on, deciding to divide the description in 2 different sections, since these specific information were missing in the ArCo ontology:</p>
     INSERISCI IMMAGINE
      <p>Deepseek‚Äôs answer: Certainly. Here are CONSTRUCT queries to add the missing descriptive data for Porta Zamboni to the ARCO ontology, using appropriate properties and creating necessary intermediate resources.</p>

  <p>As we can see, even though I used a chain-of-thought prompt, Chatgpt only made a short introduction about the element that I wanted to represent and a conclusion of the main features of the query, without a real description of its reasoning process.
I tried to execute this query in Yasgui because personally, being in different colours, the visualisation is better and most importantly, It‚Äôs easier to find possible mistakes (they are in red) so that I can quickly correct them manually. In fact, the mistake was the ‚Äú/‚Äù before restoration, drawbridge, 2007 and 1354:

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      The SPARQL queries confirm the classification of Porta San Donato as 
      architectural heritage within the ArCo dataset. The metadata retrieved 
      provide insight into its identifiers, historical context, and relation 
      to the city of Bologna. The alternative name <i>Porta Zamboni</i> 
      demonstrates the gate's strong connection to the university district.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Porta San Donato represents both a historical and cultural landmark 
      of Bologna. By leveraging Linked Open Data and SPARQL queries, 
      detailed information can be systematically retrieved, 
      enabling comparative analysis with other medieval gates.
