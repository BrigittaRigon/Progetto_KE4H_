<h1>Porta Castiglione, Bologna</h1>

<p>
Porta Castiglione, also known as the Gate of the Canals, was built in the second half of the
13th century as part of Bologna‚Äôs third and final circle of walls. Its proximity to the Canale di
Savena, which powered numerous mills, gave it both military importance (with a tower and
drawbridge) and economic relevance. A symbol of Bologna‚Äôs dual medieval identity: a
fortified city and a productive center tied to its waterways; it now stands as an architectural
and cultural testimony to the city‚Äôs urban development. I chose to enrich its record because it
represents a key element of Bologna‚Äôs historical and cultural identity: updating its entry
allows for a more complete representation of the city‚Äôs past and strengthens its visibility
within heritage knowledge graphs.

<h2>1st Step: SPARQL queries to find missing information</h2>

<h3>DESCRIBE query</h3>
<p>
The first step was using a DESCRIBE query to see the properties and objects belonging
to Porta Castiglione. I found it useful to see if it is already well described or not, and to
see which properties may be missing.
</p>

<pre>
PREFIX arco: &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/&gt;
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;

DESCRIBE
&lt;https://w3id.org/arco/resource/ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage/0800241613&gt;
Result: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2r9xtap6">https://tinyurl.com/2r9xtap6</a>
</pre>

<p>
It appears that Porta Castiglione is already well-described in the ArCo ontology, but we
could definitely enrich its profile with some interesting additional information, such as the
ancient name it was known by and the ring of walls it belongs to.
</p>

<h3>SELECT query</h3>

<pre>
PREFIX arco: &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/&gt;
SELECT ?ancientName ?wallRing
WHERE {
 &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/resource/ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage/0800241613&gt; ?p ?o .

 OPTIONAL {
 &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/resource/ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage/0800241613&gt;
 arco:hasAncientName ?ancientName. }
 OPTIONAL {
 &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/resource/ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage/0800241613&gt;
 arco:isPartOfWallRing ?wallRing. }
}
LIMIT 10
Result: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2f9f9m8c">https://tinyurl.com/2f9f9m8c</a>
</pre>

<p>
It looks like these two pieces of information are not present in the ArCo ontology.
</p>

<h2>2nd Step: How LLMs can enhance the ArCo knowledge graph</h2>

<p>
I used three different LLMs, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to help me find the missing
information. I asked each model the same question and then evaluated and compared their
answers.
</p>

<h3>Zero-shot prompt</h3>
<p>
‚ÄúTell me the ancient name Porta Castiglione used to be known as and the ring of walls it
belongs to‚Äù
</p>
<h4>ChatGPT‚Äôs answer:</h4>
<div class="img-container">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/main/Images/porta%20castiglione%201.png" alt="Porta Castiglione">
</div>
 <div class="img-container">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/refs/heads/main/Images/porta%20castiglione%202.png" alt="Porta Castiglione">
</div> 
<p>
ChatGPT provided accurate answers, though they lacked in-depth detail. The model did,
however, cite its sources and include relevant images, which helped to support the
information provided.
</p>

<h4>GEMINI‚Äôs answer:</h4>
   <div class="img-container">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/refs/heads/main/Images/porta%20castiglione%203.png">
</div> 
<p>
GEMINI‚Äôs answer was the shortest one. Although the model provided correct answers, they
tended to be brief and not very detailed. This can indeed be a positive aspect when someone
is trying to retrieve a specific piece of information and needs a concise answer, but it can also
be a drawback if more context or explanation is needed. It didn‚Äôt mention its sources.
</p>

<h4>Deep Seek‚Äôs answer:</h4>
    <div class="img-container">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/refs/heads/main/Images/porta%20castiglione%204.png">
</div>
     <div class="img-container">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/refs/heads/main/Images/porta%20castiglione%205.png">
</div>
   <div class="img-container">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/refs/heads/main/Images/porta%20castiglione%206.png">

  </div>
   <div class="img-container">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrigittaRigon/Progetto_KE4H_/refs/heads/main/Images/porta%20castiglione%207.png">
</div>
<p>
Deep Seek‚Äôs answer was definitely the longest and most accurate. Not only did it provide the
correct answers, but it also delved deeper into the content, adding additional interesting
details and a useful final summary for memorization. However, it didn‚Äôt mention its sources.

<h3>Few-shots chain-of-thought prompt</h3>
<p>
I then used a CONSTRUCT query to add this information to the ArCo ontology. I asked
ChatGPT and Deep Seek to help me create a CONSTRUCT query through a few-shots
chain-of-thought prompt.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúHi, I need to enrich the entity 0800241636 (Porta Castiglione in Bologna) in the ArCo
knowledge graph with some new triplets. I noticed that in the page the following
information is missing:<br>
- The ancient name Porta Castiglione used to be known as (answer: Porta dei Canali);<br>
- The ring of walls it belongs to (answer: the third one).<br>
Can you create a construct query for ArCo with all this information, following these two
examples: ... Let‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù

<h3>Zero-shots chain-of-thought prompt</h3>
<p>
Later, I decided to add one more information, that was missing in the ArCo ontology, that is
the Bolognese name of Porta Castiglione: P√¥rta Casti√≥n (source:
<a href="https://www.bulgnais.com/manuale/lessico-fraseologia.html">https://www.bulgnais.com/manuale/lessico-fraseologia.html</a>). Therefore, I asked this with a
zero-shots chain of thought.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúHi, can you help me enrich the ArCo entity of Porta Castiglione in Bologna (0800241636)
using the CONSTRUCT function of SPARQL? I want to add that the Bolognese name is
P√¥rta Casti√≥n. Let's think step-by-step.‚Äù

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Even though Porta Castiglione was already present in the ArCo ontology, by experimenting with SPARQL queries and the support of different LLMs I was able to enrich its description with valuable missing details, such as its ancient name Porta dei Canali, the fact that it belongs to the third ring of walls, and even its Bolognese name P√¥rta Casti√≥n. This process allowed me not only to verify and compare the outputs of multiple models, but also to integrate them with external sources in order to build a more complete and reliable knowledge graph entry. At the beginning, approaching LLMs for SPARQL query generation was not entirely straightforward, but gradually it became an engaging way to learn how semantic enrichment can enhance the representation of cultural heritage. Overall, this work turned out to be both challenging and rewarding, since it deepened my understanding of Porta Castiglione as a symbol of Bologna‚Äôs medieval and economic identity while also highlighting how AI can contribute to preserving and disseminating local history.
