    <h1>Porta Castiglione, Bologna</h1>

    <p>
        Porta Castiglione, also known as the Gate of the Canals, was built in the second half of the
        13th century as part of Bologna‚Äôs third and final circle of walls. Its proximity to the Canale di
        Savena, which powered numerous mills, gave it both military importance (with a tower and
        drawbridge) and economic relevance. A symbol of Bologna‚Äôs dual medieval identity: a
        fortified city and a productive center tied to its waterways; it now stands as an architectural
        and cultural testimony to the city‚Äôs urban development. I chose to enrich its record because it
        represents a key element of Bologna‚Äôs historical and cultural identity: updating its entry
        allows for a more complete representation of the city‚Äôs past and strengthens its visibility
        within heritage knowledge graphs.

    <h2>1st Step: SPARQL queries to find missing information</h2>

    <h3>DESCRIBE query</h3>
    <p>
        The first step was using a DESCRIBE query to see the properties and objects belonging
        to Porta Castiglione. I found it useful to see if it is already well described or not, and to
        see which properties may be missing.

    <p>
        It appears that Porta Castiglione is already well-described in the ArCo ontology, but we
        could definitely enrich its profile with some interesting additional information, such as the
        ancient name it was known by and the ring of walls it belongs to.
    </p>

    <h3>SELECT query</h3>

        It looks like these two pieces of information are not present in the ArCo ontology.
    </p>

    <h2>2nd Step: How LLMs can enhance the ArCo knowledge graph</h2>

    <p>
        I used three different LLMs, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to help me find the missing
        information. I asked each model the same question and then evaluated and compared their
        answers.
    </p>

    <h3>Zero-shot prompt</h3>
    <p>
        ‚ÄúTell me the ancient name Porta Castiglione used to be known as and the ring of walls it
        belongs to‚Äù
    </p>

    <h4>ChatGPT‚Äôs answer</h4>
    <p>
        ChatGPT provided accurate answers, though they lacked in-depth detail. The model did,
        however, cite its sources and include relevant images, which helped to support the
        information provided.
    </p>

    <h4>GEMINI‚Äôs answer</h4>
    <p>
        GEMINI‚Äôs answer was the shortest one. Although the model provided correct answers, they
        tended to be brief and not very detailed. This can indeed be a positive aspect when someone
        is trying to retrieve a specific piece of information and needs a concise answer, but it can also
        be a drawback if more context or explanation is needed. It didn‚Äôt mention its sources.

    <h4>DeepSeek‚Äôs answer</h4>

        Ancient Name and Wall Ring Details<br>
        Even today, Bolognese often use the two names interchangeably, though "Porta Saragozza" remains
        deeply ingrained in the local identity, especially for the surrounding neighborhood.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. The Ring of Walls: The Cerchia dei Torresotti (Second Walls)<br>
        This is the crucial part of your question. Porta Castiglione/Saragozza was a main gate in Bologna's second
        medieval circle of walls, built in the 12th century (specifically, begun around 1176).<br>
        Common Names: This set of walls is most famously known as the Cerchia dei Torresotti. The name
        "Torresotti" comes from the small towers (torresotte) that guarded the city's gates. These gates were
        often built under the towers, hence the name.<br>
        Structure: Unlike the later, larger third walls, the second circle was not as high or imposing. It was built
        at a time of rapid city expansion and increasing civic pride. Many sections of these walls were
        incorporated into later buildings as the city grew.<br>
        Visibility Today: You can still see clear remnants of this second circle. The best examples are the four
        surviving torresotti gates themselves, which now stand in the middle of busy streets, stranded as the
        walls were demolished: Porta delle Lame (the most intact)
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course. You've asked an excellent question that touches on the layered history of Bologna.
        The ancient name for what is now Porta Castiglione was Porta Saragozza.
        It belongs to the Cerchia dei Torresotti (or "dei Mille"), which is also commonly known as the second
        circle of walls (la seconda cerchia).<br>
        Here is a more detailed breakdown:<br>
        1. The Ancient Name: Porta Saragozza<br>
        Origin: The gate was originally constructed in the 13th century and named after the main road it
        served, the Via Saragozza. This road was an important route leading out of the city towards the west
        and eventually to the hilltop Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca.<br>
        Name Change: It was renamed Porta Castiglione in the 16th century (sometime after 1508) because
        the road it served was also known as Strada Castiglione, which led to the nearby town of Castiglione
        dei Pepoli.<br>
        Even today, Bolognese often use the two names interchangeably, though "Porta Saragozza" remains
    </p>

    <p>
        Deep Seek‚Äôs answer was definitely the longest and most accurate. Not only did it provide the
        correct answers, but it also delved deeper into the content, adding additional interesting
        details and a useful final summary for memorization. However, it didn‚Äôt mention its sources.<br>
        Sources:<br>

    </p>

    <h2>CONSTRUCT query to enrich ArCo</h2>
    <p>
        I then used a CONSTRUCT query to add this information to the ArCo ontology. I asked
        ChatGPT and Deep Seek to help me create a CONSTRUCT query through a few-shots
        chain-of-thought prompt.
    </p>

    <p>
        ‚ÄúHi, I need to enrich the entity 0800241636 (Porta Castiglione in Bologna) in the ArCo
        knowledge graph with some new triplets. I noticed that in the page the following
        information is missing:<br>
        - The ancient name Porta Castiglione used to be known as (answer: Porta dei Canali);<br>
        - The ring of walls it belongs to (answer: the third one).<br>
        Can you create a construct query for ArCo with all this information, following these two
        examples: ... Let‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù
    </p>
